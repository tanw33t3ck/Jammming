What did you like about this project?
This project gave me an opportunity to create a front-end application that works with a Web API(Spotify). It was challenging and required a lot of research and reading on my own to complete.

What did you struggle with in this project?
This was a very difficult project and the spike in difficulty from what we were taught in Codecademy was great. I felt that what was taught in Codecademy was insufficient to fill the knowledge gap required to complete this project. In order to fill the gap, I had to do a lot of searching and reading.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Reduce the scope of the project. 
Go through a similar project in class but on a smaller scale.
Run through various components required for the app so we understand how each of these components work. Especially the Spotify.js component.
